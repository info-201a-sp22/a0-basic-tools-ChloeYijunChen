## Data Viz Summary ✏️
This data visualization communicates that the number of women awarded with Computer science bachelor degrees is far less than their male counterparts throughout 1970 to 2010 in the United States. The number of women computer science graduates in the United States peaked in 1984 at 37 percent. However, the percentage of women computer science graduates has been declining since then to 26 percent today.
As Sara Blumenstein said:
> The demographics of data science (and related occupations like software engineering and artificial intelligence research) do not represent the population as a whole.

What's worse, technical companies hire even fewer numbers of women employees to take up computer science or research jobs.
